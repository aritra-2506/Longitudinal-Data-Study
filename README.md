# Longitudinal-Study-on-Proteomics-Dataset-using-Machine-Learning

Longitudinal analysis is performed on longitudinal data also called as panel data for multiomics datasets. Different omics datasets were taken into consideration for performing different model analysis to evaluate the efficiency and accuracy. Omics datasets include proteomics, transcriptomics etc.

Tasks:

1. Per patient all proteins weekly plot
2. Per protein all patients weekly plot
3. Repeat 1 and 2 with data normalized between 0 and 1
4. Binning
5. Data Splitting
6. Random Forest
7. Feature selection
8. Time series per patient
9. Time series per protein
